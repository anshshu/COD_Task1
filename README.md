Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Task Description The goal of this task is to explore the characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers present in a dataset. I gained insights into the data through visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps. This repository contains the code and visualizations for the task of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a dataset using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Dataset The dataset used for this analysis is the World Population Dataset. It contains population data from 1970 to 2022 for countries around the world. The dataset provides insights into population trends over time

The objective is to classify tweets as containing hate speech or not using machine learning techniques.

Dataset Size: 31,962 labeled tweets. Features: Text content of tweets. Labels: Binary classification (1 for hate speech, 0 for non-hate speech). Methodology Data Preprocessing:

Removal of Twitter handles, special characters, and numbers. Tokenization and stemming. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualization of frequent words and hashtags. image image image Feature Extraction:

Conversion of text data to numerical matrices using CountVectorizer. Model Training and Evaluation:

Logistic Regression model trained on bag-of-words representation. Performance evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC score. Confusion matrix visualization for analyzing predictions. Results Trained model achieved 95% accuracy. F1-score was 54% and ROC AUC score were 94%, respectively. Confusion matrix provided insights into model performance. Conclusion This project demonstrates the application of NLP and machine learning for social media sentiment analysis, aiding in the detection of hate speech. Future work includes exploring advanced NLP models and real-time deployment.# Codtech-task1
